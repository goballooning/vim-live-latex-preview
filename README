Note: 
- bin/ contains some bash scripts used by the plugin. Add it to your PATH.
- Some code in ftplugin/tex/live-latex-preview.vim are commented. that part is not necessary for pathogen users.

- I will update this Repository as soon as I notice a newer version of vim-live-latex-preview. 
- I created a alert and made it a recipe on ifttt: http://ifttt.com/recipes/2999. (I do not varify whether it really works, as there is no update for vim-live-latex-preview since then.)

Warning:
- This is an unofficial clone of vim-live-latex-preview by Kevin C. Klement <klement@philos.umass.edu>
